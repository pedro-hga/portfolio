about: "The goal of this project was the full-stack development of a complete application, with each team member responsible for developing at least one feature from the back-end to the front-end. In addition to this, the majority of my contribution was related to the front-end development of the application."

      <div class="light fs-18 list-unstyled mt-1">
        <p>As our first full application using Ruby on Rails, we embarked on a journey to grasp the intricacies of the framework, from understanding its operation to effectively organizing files as the project expanded, and learning how to debug emerging errors.</p>
        <p>Our initial challenge lay in structuring our data to facilitate CRUD operations. While this seemed straightforward at first, and we had to deal layers of complexities, particularly when implementing authentication. This experience underscored the importance of meticulousness in database management.</p>
        <p>This project served as an invaluable introduction to developing full-stack applications. Though relatively modest in scope, it provided us with a solid grasp of RESTful design principles and proficiency in CRUD operations.</p>
        <p>During the front-end development phase, we encountered the pitfalls of over-reliance on Bootstrap. While initially expedient, we discovered its limitations when customizing features or accommodating evolving project needs. Although Bootstrap accelerates development, its indiscriminate use can lead to complications and hinder flexibility.</p>
        <p>These challenges afforded us valuable insights into the significance of collaboration and communication in project development. We realized the interconnectedness of various components and our reliance on each other to achieve project objectives.</p>
