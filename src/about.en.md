<p class="fw-bold orange fs-3">TL;DR</p>
<p class="fs-18">
  From Architect and Urban Planner to Full-stack Developer, I thrive in collaborative work environments, always excited about opportunities to learn and solve problems. Always curious how people interact with what we design and what we can do to improve them. My expertise lies in using Ruby on Rails + Hotwire, JavaScript (VanillaJS, Stimulus), SCSS/SASS, and HTML for developing full-fledged applications.

## From <span class="blue"><em>blueprints</em></span> to <span class="red mono">{code}</span>

Before venturing into the world of web development, I was an architect and urbanist, specializing in digital architecture (3D models and Building Information Modeling) and in management and coordination, both project management and workflow management in architecture offices. Over the past years, the experience gained in architecture enabled me to become an educator, assisting various students in excelling in an increasingly demanding architectural production market with increasingly complex software.

Quickly, the experience as an educator and communicator soon allowed the transition from working in architecture offices to a consulting service, helping offices to implement workflows and software that are now requirements for architectural production. Being specialized in digital architecture led me to explore code within the architectural field, and there is much to be done to merge code and architecture, from visual programming (nodes) to algorithmic design, data science, and so on.

At this point, I already knew that programming was what I wanted, but it was in a class of my postgraduate course that I ventured into creating with code, which was a class about Processing, and then everything sort of fell into place. I wanted to create something that people could interact with on a daily basis, outside the most abstract ways of dealing with code within architecture, and that's where web development came into play.

Web development allows me to enjoy some things that I missed in architecture, such as creating a product that is accessible to more people (instead of a property with exorbitant prices), and also more collaboration opportunities, which, in my experience, lacks in architecture.

In terms of experience, there are many similarities between architecture and programming, which provides me with a solid foundation to approach a career in web development, such as dealing with large and complex projects, as buildings are extremely complex, managing expectations, whether from a client or users, and project management, as being a BIM (Building Information Modeling) manager.
