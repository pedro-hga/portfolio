<h3 class="orange fw-500">TL;DR</h3>

From Architect and Urban Planner to Full Stack Web Developer, I thrive in collaborative workspaces and am enthusiastic about learning and problem-solving. Always curious about how people interact with things and what could we do to make it better.

## From <span class="blue">blueprints</span> to <code class="red mono">{code}</code>



Before I stepped into the world of web development, I was an architect and urban planner, specialized in managing and coordination, both within projects and workflows into architectural offices. Over the past few years, my work in architecture involved a lot of detailed drawings and analysis that helped shape me into an educator, helping hundreds of students excel into a new era of architectural production with more and more complex software. This allowed me to move past working in an office to consulting practices, helping then offices to implement workflows and software that today are requirements to architectural production.


Being specialized in digital architecture led me to tinker with code within the architectural realm, and there's a lot to be done to fuse both code and architecture together, from visual (nodes) programming, to algorithmic design, to data science, and the list goes on. At that point, I already knew that coding was what I wanted, but was at a class in my graduate course, that I got to venture myself with creating with code, which was a class on Processing, and then it all kind of fell into place, I wanted to create something that people could interact with on a daily basis, outside of the more abstract ways to deal with code within architecture, and that's when Web Development came into place.


Web development allows me to enjoy a couple of things that I missed in architecture, which was making a product for *everyone*, and collaboration, which surprisingly, in my experience, lacks in architecture. As far as the experience goes, there's a lot of similarities between architecture and coding, that gives me a solid foundation to approach a web development career, like handling of large and complex projects, as buildings are extremely complex, handling expectations, either from a client or user, and project management, being a BIM (Building Information Modeling) mananger. 

**Here's a few of my highlights:**
- <span class="orange">Technical Proficiency:</span> I'm actively immersed and always curious in learning and understanding how the latest web development tools and frameworks can move things forward, ensuring my contributions are always relevant.
- <span class="orange">Collaborative skills:</span> Having thrived in multidisciplinary teams throughout my architectural career and my work as an educator, I cultivated strong communication skills and the ability to seamlessly collaborate with diverse groups.
- <span class="orange">Project Management Expertise:</span> From architectural projects to consulting, I have a proven track record of managing complex endeavors, ensuring efficient execution and successful outcomes.
